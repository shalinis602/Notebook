Welcome to my online notebook! It's a collection of my personal notes and insights gathered during my study and work, sync'd regularly from my Obsidian notes. Here, you'll find a mix of raw ideas, research findings, and reflections, all organized for quick access and future reference. They're pretty raw and unpolished right now, though I do try my best to categorize and tag them. I plan to improve and organize them over time.
